👋 About Me

Hey, I’m a cybersecurity fresher who’s mainly into penetration testing and learning how systems break so they can be secured better.

I like getting hands-on with things like:

🕵️‍♂️ Web & network pentesting basics

🔎 Finding vulnerabilities and understanding why they exist

🛠️ Tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit (beginner level)

🐧 Linux, networking, and scripting fundamentals

Most of my learning comes from labs, CTFs, and small practice projects rather than just theory. I enjoy digging into vulnerabilities, testing exploits in safe environments, and writing down what I learn so I don’t repeat mistakes.

Right now, I’m focused on:

Improving web app pentesting skills

Learning common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

Building a strong pentester mindset and methodology

🎯 Goal: Become a solid penetration tester and keep leveling up through consistent practice.
